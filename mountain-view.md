<summary>Shopping</summary>

*   #### Kad Farang

    In Thai language, "Kad" means "village", "farang" means "white people". This area has historically been inhabited by many expats, so it has a well-established business system where you will feel no different from being in the United States - Starbucks, Western restaurants, Korean restaurants, Japanese restaurants, international supermarkets, and even outlet.&#x20;

    It is only about 15 minutes from the Mountain View, and you can buy all the things and services you need here. Every Wednesday and weekends they also have night market here.
