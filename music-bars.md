This jazz bar at the north gate of the old city looks like this in the photo almost every night: so crowded that customers can only stand on the road to listen. There's plenty of wild jazz improvisation going on here, and it's recommended to come early to get a spot.

Compared to north gate, this is a more localized music bar, it provides many local young people like students a chance to perform with their bands, where you can see a perfect blend of jazz and reed-pipe.
