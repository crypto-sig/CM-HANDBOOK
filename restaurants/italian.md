Located at the foot of Suthep Mountain, this cute Italian Restaurant is also a small cheese factory. Here you can get really excellent hard cheese, soft cheese, and semi-soft cheese at 1/3 the price of imported supermarkets. Of course you can also enjoy delicious pasta, salads and pizza here, and the pizza is particularly impressive!
