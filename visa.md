# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Visa

Thailand is a very accessible country and welcomes people from all over the world.&#x20;

For crypto nomads who travel frequently between countries, you can enter Thailand multiple times using a Visa Exemption or Visa-on-Arrival.&#x20;

For those who plan to stay in Thailand for a longer period of time, it's a good idea to apply for a Tourist Visa in advance. This will allow you to convert to a long-term visa during your two-month visa period without having to leave Thailand.&#x20;

This information is useful for anyone who wants to visit Thailand from anywhere in the world.
